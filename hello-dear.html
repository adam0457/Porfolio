                <p>Hello Dear is an app that provides seniors with a platform to connect with friends and 
                  family, access resources for healthy living, and engage in activities that promote overall 
                  well-being.

                    <li>We have used AWS Amplify for the back-end and Amazon Cognito to handle the authentication process.</li>
                    <li>We have used Figma to create the initial designs and to build the prototype.</li>
                    <li>We have used Git and GitHub to regularly merge code changes from separate branches 
                      allowing frequent integration of code. That helped us catch integration issues early

              <p>For this project we followed the UX Design Pattern with an agile approach. </p>
              <p>We started by doing User Research to understand the needs of the seniors so that we can come up with some realistic features. For that we gathered data from user interviews that we conducted. </p>
              <p>Knowing that the project would take longer than the 4 months that we had, we built a realistic Roadmap with the client to identify the different phases of the project along with the features.</p>
              <p>Then we move on to Analysis, Design, Prototype and User Testing.</p>
              <p>During the process we also organized a meeting with our client every two weeks to review and validate the steps we have covered.</p>
